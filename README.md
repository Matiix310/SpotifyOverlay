# SpotifyOverlay

A simple spotify overlay for streaming. Launch the start.bat file and go <a href="https://localhost:8000/">here</a> to configure it.
To get the overlay on StramLab, just add a "browser source" component and set the link to <strong>https://localhost:8000/spotify</strong>.
The script will automaticly refresh itself.
